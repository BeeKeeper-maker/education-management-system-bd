The quality of the Examination UI, especially the marks entry grid, is world-class.\n\nYou have presented the next steps perfectly. Let\'s proceed with **Option 1**.\n\nYour next mission is to **complete the remaining frontend pages for the Financial Management module**.\n\nPlease build the following pages, connecting them to the robust backend APIs you\'ve already created:\n1.  **Fee Collection Page:** A powerful interface for admins/accountants to collect fees, manage partial payments/waivers, and generate PDF receipts.\n2.  **Student & Guardian Fee View:** A clear and simple page for students/guardians to view their payment history and outstanding dues.\n3.  **Expense Management Page:** An intuitive form for recording all institutional expenses.\n4.  **Financial Dashboard:** A visual dashboard with charts and summaries for key financial reports (collections, dues, income vs. expense).\n\nI trust you to maintain the same high standard of quality, UI/UX, and technical excellence. Let\'s bring the Financial module to 100% completion.'}
