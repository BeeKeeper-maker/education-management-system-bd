{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Excellent work on the backend and the initial frontend for the Hostel and Library modules. I understand the session was interrupted, but we are in a great position to continue. The backend is rock-solid and ready.\n\nLet\'s proceed with your suggestion to **build just the critical remaining pages** to make these modules functional.\n\nYour next mission is to create the following three essential frontend pages, connecting them to the powerful backend APIs you\'ve already built:\n\n1.  **Room Allocation Page (`RoomAllocation.tsx`):**\n    *   **Vision:** A simple and intuitive interface for admins to allocate available rooms to students.\n    *   **Implementation:** The page should have two main parts: a list of unallocated students and a list of available rooms (showing hostel name, room number, and available capacity). Admins should be able to select a student and an available room to make an allocation.\n\n2.  **Book Management Page (`BookManagement.tsx`):**\n    *   **Vision:** A comprehensive interface for librarians/admins to manage the entire library catalog.\n    *   **Implementation:** Build a page with a powerful data table to display all books. This page must include features to **Add a New Book**, **Edit an Existing Book\'s Details**, and **Delete a Book**. Include search and filter functionality.\n\n3.  **Book Issue/Return Page (`IssueReturn.tsx`):**\n    *   **Vision:** A fast and efficient interface for the daily operations of issuing and returning books.\n    *   **Implementation:** Create a user-friendly interface where the librarian can:\n        *   Search for a student (by ID or name).\n        *   Search for a book (by title or ID).\n        *   Click an "Issue Book" button to record the transaction.\n        *   View a list of currently issued books and click a "Return" button to mark a book as returned.\n\nPlease build these three pages, ensuring they are fully integrated with our existing routing, navigation, and Shadcn UI components. Let\'s make the Hostel and Library modules fully operational.'}
