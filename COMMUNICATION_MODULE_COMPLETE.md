4. Update provider name in SMS logs

**Example Twilio Integration:**
```typescript
import twilio from 'twilio';

const client = twilio(
  process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID,
  process.env.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
);

async function sendViaTwilio(phone: string, message: string) {
  const result = await client.messages.create({
    body: message,
    from: process.env.TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER,
    to: phone,
  });
  
  return {
    success: true,
    messageId: result.sid,
